For question 1.
* I used pesimistic lock management to prevent more than one user from processing on the same seat at the same time.
* I wrote an integration test to realize this scenario.
* Again, I integrated the iyzipay payment system for the first question.
I used incorrect card information in the payment requests received with 555 UserID in order to realize the incorrect payment situation.
* We can use Swagger for api testing of related scenarios. You can also find Postman Collection file under /main/resource.
* You can find the scripts for the database tables I created in /main/resource/db.sql/create-db.sql


For Question 2:
* I used rabbitMQ which is a message-broker management. To use rabbitMq I created a docker-compose.yml file.
Please run the "docker compose up -d" command in the file directory with the relevant file before starting the project.
